# Swing Login GUI With Toast

I created this project, because I was sick of how Swing GUIs typically look. In my opinion, this is a much more user-friendly UI than anything I've seen online. Enjoy!

**Note:** If an NPE is thrown when you first run this project, your IDE probably doesn't recognize your `resources` directory as a resources directory.
